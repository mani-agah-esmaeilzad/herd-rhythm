## Backend API & Database

The application now exposes a RESTful API powered by Next.js API routes and backed by a PostgreSQL database via Prisma. The primary endpoints are:

| Route | Methods | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `/api/cows` | `GET`, `POST` | List cows or create a new cow record. |
| `/api/cows/[id]` | `GET`, `PUT`, `DELETE` | Retrieve, update, or remove a specific cow. |
| `/api/reminders` | `GET`, `POST` | Manage reminder collection. |
| `/api/reminders/[id]` | `GET`, `PATCH`, `PUT`, `DELETE` | Work with a single reminder, including completion updates. |
| `/api/sync-methods` | `GET`, `POST` | Manage synchronization protocol definitions. |
| `/api/sync-methods/[id]` | `GET`, `PUT`, `DELETE` | View or modify a specific synchronization method. |
| `/api/analytics` | `GET` | Returns dashboard analytics calculated from live data. |

### Local setup

1. Copy the example environment file and update the `DATABASE_URL` with your PostgreSQL connection string:

   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Install dependencies (once registry access is available) and generate the Prisma client:

   ```sh
   npm install
   npx prisma generate
   ```

3. Create the database schema and seed it with the sample herd data:

   ```sh
   npm run db:push
   npm run db:seed
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

The sample seed mirrors the original mock data so the UI continues to display meaningful analytics immediately.

### Deploying to Vercel

1. Provision a PostgreSQL database (Vercel Postgres, Neon, Supabase, etc.) and copy the connection string.
2. In your Vercel project settings, add the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.
3. Configure the build command to run Prisma before the Next.js build if you manage the deployment manually:

   ```sh
   npx prisma generate
   npx prisma migrate deploy
   ```

   When deploying via Vercel’s Git integration, you can add these commands to the **Build Command** or a [post-install script](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/configure-a-build#install-command) as needed.
4. Trigger a redeploy. The API routes will automatically connect to the provisioned database at runtime using the `DATABASE_URL` secret.

For Vercel Postgres specifically, ensure `?sslmode=require` is appended to the URL and enable the "Prisma" integration to manage connection pooling automatically.
